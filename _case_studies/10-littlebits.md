Colin was part of the founding team of modular electronics platform [littleBits](https://littlebits.cc), and as VP Software he designed, architected, built and launched a consumer Internet of Things (IoT) Platform, the [littleBits CloudBit](https://littlebits.cc/cloudstart). Since littleBits is an analog electronics system, we needed to design the connection from analog to digital, from physical to virtual; and then keep the incredible ease of use "snapping it together" while extending from APIs to web and mobile apps.

He also ran all web & mobile technology from marketing and ecommerce to user community platform while building the digital team from 1 to 20 people as the company grew over 3 funding rounds.
