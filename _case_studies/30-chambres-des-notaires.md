In Québec, notaries perform many important functions that are reserved for lawyers in the US; all matters related to family law, real estate law, and successions and testament law. The Chambre des Notaires is the oldest professional association in Québec and provides the administrative structure for all notaries in Québec to perform and organize their legal work.

Céline completely redesigned their internal intranet and member tools platform, [«Inforoute Notariale»](https://inforoute.cdnq.org), from the perspective of organizational and process design, human-centered usability, information architecture, branding and visual design.
